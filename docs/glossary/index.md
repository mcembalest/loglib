# Glossary

## Agent

A system that takes actions in an environment.

## Attention

Mechanism that lets models focus on specific parts of input.

## Autoregression

Predicting next values based on previous ones.

## Backpropagation

Algorithm that trains neural networks by adjusting weights.

## Classification

Sorting data into categories.

## Convolution

Operation that combines signals.

## Decoder

Converts encoded data back to output.

## Deep Learning

Machine learning with many-layered neural networks.

## Encoder

Compresses input data into a representation.

## Entropy

Measure of uncertainty in data.

## Feature

A measurable property of data. Typically corresponds to the most important or useful aspects of a model that can be directly captured in data and trained on for modeling.

## Gradient

Direction of steepest increase in a function.

## Hyperparameter

Settings that can be chosen when running a process, for exmaple when training a model.

## Inference

Running a trained model to generate outputs.

## Loss Function

Measures how wrong a model's predictions are.

## Matrix

Grid of values arranged in rows and columns for representing data and transformations.

## Neural Network

Network of connected parameters trained to model data.

## Overfitting

When a model memorizes training data too well and fails to make correct predictions on new data.


## Precision

Fraction of predictions that are correct.

## Probability

How likely something is to happen between 0% and 100%.

## Recall

Fraction of relevant items that were found.

## Regression

Predicting continuous numbers.

## Regularization

Techniques to prevent overfitting.

## Reinforcement Learning

Learning through trial and error with rewards in an environment.

## Supervised Learning

Learning from labeled examples.

## Tensor

Multi-dimensional array of numbers.

## Token

Basic unit of sequences (for example, in language modeling, a token is either a small word, a part of word, or some other small sequence of text characters).

## Transformer

Neural network architecture using attention in an encoder-decoder stack.

## Unsupervised Learning

Finding patterns in data without labels.

## Weight

Parameter in a neural network that determines the strength of an edge (connection between nodes) in the network.
