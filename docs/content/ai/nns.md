# Neural Networks (NNs)

Functions inspired by the brain that are trained to model data

Typically composed as a graph of stacked and connected layers of nodes

Density in neural networks (more connections between nodes, more spiking activations) tends to be preferred when the desire is to express a wider array of functions

Sparsity in neural networks (fewer connections between nodes, fewer spiking activations) when the desire is to improve speed and reduce memory usage
